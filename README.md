# Stroke Prediction Model
A machine learning project to predict stroke risk using clinical and lifestyle features. This repository walks though the complete workflow: data analysis, preprocessing, model training, evaluation interpretability, and calibration

# Introduction
Stroke is the leading cause of mortaility and disbaility. early risk detection can enable preventive healthcare intervention and reduce long-term burden. This project builds predictive models on a public healthcare dataset to classify patients as at risk of stroke (stroke = 1) or not (stroke = 0).

Data Overview
