# Stroke Prediction Model

## Abstract  
This research implements machine learning methodologies to develop a predictive model for stroke risk assessment utilizing clinical and demographic features. The study addresses the critical healthcare challenge of early stroke detection through advanced statistical modeling and machine learning techniques.

## Methodology  

### Data Characteristics  
The dataset comprises heterogeneous patient records with continuous and categorical variables. The target variable exhibits class imbalance with a 1:10 ratio of stroke to non-stroke cases, as illustrated in Figure 1.

### Feature Analysis
The dataset includes both continuous and categorical variables:
- **Continuous Variables:** age, average glucose level, BMI  
- **Categorical Variables:** gender, residence type, work type, marital status, smoking status  

Distribution analysis of key continuous variables revealed significant patterns, as shown in Figure 2.

### Feature Engineering  
- **Continuous Variables:**
  - Standardization applied  
  - Missing value imputation via median substitution  
- **Categorical Variables:**
  - One-hot encoding implementation  
  - Mode-based imputation for missing values  

### Model Development  
Multiple classification algorithms were evaluated:  
1. Logistic Regression with balanced class weights  
2. Random Forest with class-weight optimization  
3. XGBoost with gradient boosting  
4. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) combined with Logistic Regression

## Results

### Feature Attribution  
Analysis revealed age, blood pressure, and glucose levels as primary predictive indicators, consistent with established clinical literature (Figure 7).

## Conclusions  
The Random Forest classifier demonstrated superior performance in balancing sensitivity and specificity. However, the identification of certain stroke cases remains challenging, as evidenced by the confusion matrix metrics (14 true positives versus 37 false negatives). The study's findings contribute to the growing body of literature on machine learning applications in preventive healthcare.

The research highlights the potential and limitations of machine learning in clinical prediction tasks, suggesting areas for future investigation in feature engineering and model optimization.
